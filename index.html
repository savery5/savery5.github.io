<body>
    <p>An ancient form of cheesecake may have been a popular dish in ancient Greece even prior to Romans' adoption of it with the conquest of Greece. The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician Aegimus who wrote a book on the art of making cheesecakes. The earliest extant cheesecake recipes are found in Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura. Placenta cake is the most like modern cheesecakes: having a crust that is separately prepared and baked.</p>
    <p>Chicago style Cheesecake is known for its firm outside and soft and creamy center, which comes from the extra cream cheese that is added to the batter.</p>

    <h3>Cheesecake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the cream cheese into the bowl of a stand mixer and using the paddle attachment, mix the cream cheese on medium-low speed until softened. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and under the paddle often. The process should take 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar and flour and continue to mix on low until blended (scraping down the sides as needed).</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time and mix for about 10 seconds or until just combined.</li>

        <li>Remove the crust from the freezer and pour in the cheesecake filling.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the cheesecake into the preheated water bath. Bake the cheesecake for 12 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Let the cheesecake continue to bake until the top of the cheesecake turns golden, which should be about 50 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the cheesecake on a wire rack to cool.</li>
        <li>After cooling, refrigerate the cheesecake for a minimum of 6 hours. Overnight is best.</li>
